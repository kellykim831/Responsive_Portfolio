# Updated Responsive_Portfolio


The responsive portfolio was an interesting and challenging project to create a responsive design that renders well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Using Bootstrap's amazing components, I did my best to create my responsive portfolio site. 
Each section on the site will help the audience get to know a little bit more about me. The about me page features a summary about my life and my interests. The portfolio section will give a quick view of the projects that I will have completed by the end of this course. Lastly, the contact page provides a section for anyone interested in my work to contact me by leaving a message. I'm excited for this site to showcase all of my work by the end of this program.

## Process
Getting started on my responsive portfolio was a great way for me to practice building a website! I feel satisfied on how each section came out. Below is a gif of how my updated portfolio looks like:

Creating a code for the about me section was an arduous task. I was debating if I should combine a card code along with a grid system to create a specific layout, but in the end after trial and error the combination of the codes came out alright. I took a piece of a code from a card component and wrapped it around the grid code to create the white box pictured above.
